      'Decide who approves storms, how soon after the trigger depth plows roll, and what the escalation plan looks like for ice events. Share a single emergency contact list with your contractor and internal team. Nothing slows reopening like confusion between property management, tenants, and the plow crew.',

      'Commercial lots often require simultaneous plow, sidewalk, and loader work. Bundle those services under one provider so liability stays with a single team. When piles grow too large, schedule hauling to off-site snow dumps before freeze–thaw cycles turn them into concrete.',
      'GD Landscaping’s fleet includes loaders, skid steers, sidewalk crews, and salt trucks, so you only need one point of contact all winter.'
