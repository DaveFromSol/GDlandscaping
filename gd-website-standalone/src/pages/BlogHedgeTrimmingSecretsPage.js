      'Deciduous hedges prefer a heavy cut in late winter and a light touch-up mid-summer. Evergreens do best with two lighter trims once new growth flushes out. Always start cuts at the base and work upward, keeping the hedge slightly wider at the bottom so sunlight reaches every branch.',

      'Long-reach shears are perfect for crisp tops, while articulated hedge trimmers shape curves and taller screens. Keep blades razor sharp and disinfect between properties to prevent disease spread. For large reductions, pair trimmers with pole saws so youâ€™re not tearing branches.',
      'Our trucks carry on-board blade sharpeners and cleaning kits so every cut stays clean.'
